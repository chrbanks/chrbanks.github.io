    <h1>Starting A New Blog With Jekyll</h1>

  <article class="post-content">
  <p>This is a log of my experiences setting up a new blog with Jekyll.</p>

<p>I’ve been reading blogs for a long time.  It’s a great way to learn and keep up with things.  I’ve also flirted with the idea of creating my own programming blog as a way to share information and improve my writing skills among other things.  At various points I would create accounts at free hosted blog sites, but I would never actually do anything with them, coming up with all sorts of excuses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“What if I post something incredibly stupid?”</li>
  <li>“What if I put a lot of effort into this and no one cares?”</li>
  <li>“I prefer online anonymity”</li>
</ul>

<p>Things like these have done nothing but prevent me from moving toward my goals. So recently I decided I was just going to push forward and start blogging.  Then it was time to figure out how I was going to do it.</p>

<h1 id="why-i-chose-jekyll">Why I Chose Jekyll</h1>

<p>I looked into several tools to build a blog with, but settled on three to look into deeper: WordPress, Ghost, and Jekyll.  I spent several days after work researching them and comparing.  WordPress seemed like a lot more than I really need at the moment.  Ghost was similar.  I really didn’t want to have to worry about databases, security, web hosting plans, etc. which led to me choosing Jekyll.  If there comes a point where Jekyll no longer meets my needs I’ll see about something else.</p>

<h1 id="installing-jekyll">Installing Jekyll</h1>

<p>Setting up a new blog was as simple as following the documentation’s <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/">Quick-start guide</a>.  This generated the default blog files, and after running the server I was able to see the blog in action locally.  The next step was to put the blog on <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages">Github Pages</a>.</p>

<p>This is where I came across an issue.  Github pages doesn’t yet support Jekyll 2.0.3, but this is what I downloaded.  So for now I’m pushing the build output to my <a href="https://github.com/chrbanks/chrbanks.github.io">repository</a>.  Once Github Pages is updated to support the newer version I’ll see about putting the source in the repository instead.</p>
